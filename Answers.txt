1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?

Ans: setTimeout schedules a callback to run after a specific time, the functions are registered in the timers phase of the event loop. On the other hand, setImmediate will schedule a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events' callbacks. Overall it depends on the requirement when to use setTimeout or setImmediate.
Example: 
Normally, regardless of which order we register these two callbacks, setImmediate will call after setTimeout callback. However when I/O events are registered, setImmediate is always call before setTimeout.

2. Explain the difference process.nextTick and setImmediate?

a. process.nextTick is not a part of event loop, it adds the callback into the nextTick queue. However setImmediate is a callback function execute in 'check' phase of event loop.

b. Node processes all the callbacks in the nextTick queue after the current operation completes and before the event loop continues. However setImmediate will schedule a callback of the event loop after IO events callbacks.

3. Name 10 modules that Node provides by default.

a. events
b. http
c. https
d. dns
e. buffer
f. fs
g. stream
h. timers
i. v8
j. zlib
